Do not decode the PreReadControl and PostReadControl attribute values, keep them as bytes.

See the issue and fix from Florian here: https://github.com/python-ldap/python-ldap/issues/399

Debian buster ships the python3-ldap package in version 3.1.0.
The fix is included in python-ldap from version 3.4.0 onwards, and possibly in the python3-ldap package provided by the Univention package repository.
