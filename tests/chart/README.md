# Helm chart unit tests

This folder contains a set of unit tests which cover the behavior of the Helm chart.

These tests are based on `helm-test-harness` and `pytest-helm`.

See <https://git.knut.univention.de/univention/dev/nubus-for-k8s/common-helm>
for further details about how to run the tests and how to develop new ones.
