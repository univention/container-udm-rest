# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)


## Context

We want to record relevant decisions made in this project.


## Decision

Relevant decisions will be logged as Lightweight Architecture Decision Records
(ADRs) within the repository as part of the documentation in the folder
`./docs/decisions`.


## Consequences

Relevant decisions are available together with the source code. This will allow
future colleagues to better understand the design and to be more productive and
successful when working with this codebase.


## More information

### Background

<https://adr.github.io/>

### Example ADR

The structure of MADR 3.0.0 <https://adr.github.io/madr/#example> is used.
